' I used the object obj because it is shorter and simpler than saying "objSubtract" 
and the reader will not think the "Subtract" in the name is the code that calls the
Subtract Function. 
' I chose this class "SubtractTwo" to explicitly define what the program is going to do, 
which is to subtract two numbers.
