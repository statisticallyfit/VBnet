' I used the object obj because it is simpler than saying "objMultiply" 
and to avoid reader confusion about what its function is. If the name was "objMultiply," 
another person may have believed the object itself caused the multiplication, rather than 
the function. 
' I chose this class "MultiplyTwo" to explicitly define what the program is going to do, 
which is to subtract two numbers.
