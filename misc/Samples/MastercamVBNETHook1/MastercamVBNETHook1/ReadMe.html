    <title>Mastercam VB.NET NETHook</title>
</head>
<p>
    Note that this NETHook class library targets the .NET 4.0 Framework and the x64 platform.

<body>
This template is a standard VB.NET class library project for use with Mastercam X7. The project 
has a reference to the NETHook3_0.dll located in the root directory of your Mastercam X7 installation. 
However, if you installed into a directory other than the default installation directory you may need to update the project reference to the NETHook3_0.dll 
in order for your project to compile.<br/><br/>
    
    I have included a resource file and a function table (.ft) that are used to associate commands with toolbar buttons. You will need to 
    rename the default RenameMe.ft file included in the project the same name as the project. For example if you create a NETHook project called 'MyVBNETHook' rename the ft file as MyVBNETHook.ft and place it in the CHooks folder. Edit the ft file so that the paths match the name of your project and the location of where your NETHook will be installed.
